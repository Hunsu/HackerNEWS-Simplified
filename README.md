# HackerNEWS-Simplified

A more simplified and straightforward version of HackerNews. The project uses BeautifulSoup, a python web scraping framework to scrape the data from the hackernews website and take ony the most relevant news and displays it on your terminal. 

The Hackernews page has many stories, articles and news that are not that relevant and useful to the community. The page isn't arranged properly to put forward the stories that have the most votes or approval.

##### The news displayed on your terminal(after you run ``hackernews.py``) is sorted by the number of votes of that specific news/article on the site. Only the news having 127 or more votes are displayed systematically on your terminal.

The project code(``hackernews.py``) has been/ is filled with useful comments that can be used to assert the process of grabbing data from the web page.

In order to understand the flow of control and how the Script operates, you can refer to ``hackernews(py).md`` to understand the working of the Script and ``BeautifulSoup.md`` for information on what features/components of the framework are used in the scripts.
